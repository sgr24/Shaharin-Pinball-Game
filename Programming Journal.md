# Pinball Game

By Shaharin Gani Rashid

## Programming Journal

### Week 1 - 7th November

Starting the assignment by brainstorming ideas and what to create, something that will not be too difficult but at the same time slightly challenge the user, testing them on what they know.

Thought of different things to make, from a pong game to pool and finally the pinball game.

Had a look through a couple of designs taking ideas from current games, and thought of ways to make it my own.

### Week 2 - 14th November

I chose what game to make, which in this case was the pinball game since I thought it wouldn't be too easy to make but also would not be too hard to recreate.

Planned out what features should be included apart from the usual paddles and springs, which concluded in having a reset zone just outside the board which is not visible to the player, as well as having bouncing objects, similar to the ones in the arcade pinball machines.

Began work with the board itself, creating the flooring, and borders and deciding on where to place the boundaries, as well as the slingshot lane.

### Week 3 - 21st November

Started adding other features within the board, took some time in deciding on what to add within the board, and ended up deciding to add one dampener as well as a couple of bouncing objects within the board, my plan was if there were too many bouncing objects the ball would just fly around within the pinball game, therefore by adding one or two dampeners it will calm the ball down, or control the ball so it does not needlessly fly around within the board.

As well as adding different objects to the board, I started planning out the script

Started with the flipper, since there were a couple of features that needed to be implemented, for example, the hinge joint, which I found confusing at first, however after a couple of Google searches and some tutorials later, I was able to familiarise myself with the hinge joint

### Week 4 - 28th November

For this week I decided to deeply focus on the scripts and make sure to get everything to efficiently work together, by taking time to focus on solely the script, it gives me time to figure out mistakes and flaws that I know I will be able to solve sooner or later.
