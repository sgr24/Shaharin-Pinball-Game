# Pinball Game Tutorial

I used this code from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAlJN8VGo94

## 1. Making the spring

Duplicate the right side of your boundary and create a new area slot to sling the ball up the board using the spring, make sure the ball fits within the new area, and create a gap so the ball can exit the new sling area to the main board
